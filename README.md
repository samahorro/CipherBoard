# CipherBoard: Interactive Encryption System

🔐 Overview
CipherBoard is an interactive encryption tool where users click on different parts of a virtual board to encrypt their messages. Instead of using traditional text-based encryption methods, this system transforms user input into a unique cipher based on click positions, patterns, and board interactions.

✨ Features
✅ Interactive Board Interface – Encrypt your message by selecting tiles on a grid.
✅ Custom Encryption Algorithm – Uses a position-based transformation for encoding.
✅ Decryption Mechanism – Retrieve the original message by following the correct sequence.
✅ File I/O Support – Encrypt and save messages to a file, then decrypt them later.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple design for ease of use.

🛠 How It Works
1️⃣ The user enters a message to encrypt.
2️⃣ They click on the board, selecting tiles to determine encryption parameters.
3️⃣ The system applies a unique transformation to scramble the message.
4️⃣ The encrypted message is saved or displayed.
5️⃣ To decrypt, the user clicks the correct tiles in the right order, restoring the original text.

📂 File Handling
Encryption: Reads a plaintext file and generates an encrypted version.
Decryption: Takes an encrypted file and reconstructs the original message.
